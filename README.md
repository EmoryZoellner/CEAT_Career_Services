Cloud Storage for CEAT Career Services Coding Projects

This repository is meant to be used by current and future Career Coaches at Oklahoma State University as a mobile cloud to store code and to ask previous authors questions. Although it is meant for our organization, anyone is free to access the code and use it per the license attached. I wish you all the best Coders!
